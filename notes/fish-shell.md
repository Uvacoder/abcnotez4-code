My Fish config: https://github.com/mrmartineau/fish

Change fish settings:

```shell

```

Reload fish shell

```shell

```

## Functions

Create new functions in `~/.config/fish/functions` e.g. `xyz.fish`

## Aliases

```sh
alias gco 'git checkout'
```

### abbr

If you add an abbr instead of an alias you'll get better auto-complete. In fish abbr more closely matches the behavior of a bash alias.

```sh
abbr -a gco git checkout
```

Will add a new abbreviation `gco` that expands to `git checkout`.

## Fisher

```
fisher self-update
```

## ssh-agent

When needing to add ssh keys to Github, [the docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent) suggest running `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"` but that does not work in fish. Run this instead:

```sh
command ssh-agent -s
```
